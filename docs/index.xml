      <description>Background Every few years, I try to figure out the Lanczos method to approximate SVD of a rectangular matrix. Unfortunately, every resource I find always leaves out enough details to confuse me. All of the information I want is available across multiple writeups, but everyone uses different notation, making things even more confusing.
This time I finally sat down and got to a point where I finally felt like I understood it.</description>

      <description>This is a blog dedicated to the fml project, which is at its heart a C++ library for high-performance dense matrix computing. Sometimes I also talk about math related to things I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about in fml.</description>
