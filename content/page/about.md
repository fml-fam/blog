This is a blog mostly dedicated to the [fml project](https://github.com/fml-fam/), a C++ framework with R bindings for high-performance dense matrix computing. Sometimes I also talk about math/computing things that I'm thinking about, usually in relation to fml.

I use a lot of LaTeX in posts, so enabling JavaScript for [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) will make things look much nicer. I don't use any kind of trackers (that I'm aware of). Currently I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. The blog framework is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a slightly modified Hugo theme [onetwothree](https://github.com/schollz/onetwothree). Source for the blog is available [here](https://github.com/fml-fam/blog).

If you find an errors or enjoyed something, please let me know. I go by wrathematics on twitter and gmail.
